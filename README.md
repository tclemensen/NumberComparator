# NumberComparator
A simple(?) Python script to see whether or not a set of numbers will be more likely to "win" if they are compared to a random set of numbers or a static set of numbers

This program is intended to try to determine whether it is a higher chance of winning the lotto by using the
same set of numbers for each draw, or if it is better to use a randomly generated set of numbers.

I have already run this code with 10 billion simulated games, the results were as follows:

- Total numbers of wins for random game: 924
- Total numbers of wins for static game: 1843

This indicates that your chances of winning will be slightly higher (about twice) if you play with a
static set of numbers vs choosing a random set for every game. However, the chances of winning Lotto are
still incredibly low. This simulation won in about 0.00003% of the games played, clearly demonstrating how
unlikely it is to win the jackpot, regardless of your strategy. 

I'm not claiming that this simulation will be representative of results in the real world. 
It was simply an interesting experiment to satisfy my curiosity.
